D-MAW: A (dis)similarity measure between strings using Minimal Absent Words (MAWs)
===

Tool for evaluating the D-MAW distance between strings and some statistics.

To compile <b>D-MAW</b>, please follow the instructions given in file INSTALL.

The results of the execution of this tool will be stored in the "RESULTS" directory. For further information about the results take a look at "RESULTS/README.md".

When publishing work that is based on the results from D-MAW please cite:
